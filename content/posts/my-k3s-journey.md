# Welcome to My DevOps Journey! ðŸš€

This is my first post deployed via CI/CD pipeline to my K3s cluster.

## What I've Built So Far:

- 2-node K3s cluster on old laptops (Toshiba + Acer)
- Monitoring with Prometheus + Grafana
- Networking with Tailscale + Cloudflare tunnels
- Glance dashboard for service overview
- Basic scripts for automating deployments and provisioning

## Next Steps:

- âœ… Master CI/CD pipelines (currently working on this!)
- Add more applications to the cluster
- Document everything

## The Setup:

This post was automatically:

1. Written in Markdown
2. Built with Hugo static site generator
3. Containerized with Docker
4. Deployed to my K3s cluster via GitHub Actions

Every time I write a new post and push to GitHub, it automatically appears on my blog running in Kubernetes!

## What's Next?

I'm planning to add more services like:

- ArgoCD for GitOps
- Harbor for container registry
- Maybe a database for some dynamic applications

Stay tuned for more updates on this DevOps journey! ðŸ“Š
